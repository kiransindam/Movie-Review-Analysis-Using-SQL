# Movie-Review-Analysis-Using-SQL-FOR-PRACTICES
 This project takes on the challenge of delving into a vast dataset of movie reviews, utilizing SQL to unravel valuable insights.
 With an organized repository boasting SQL scripts and other associated files, users can effortlessly perform a wide range of analyses on movie reviews, encompassing sentiment, ratings, and genre. Your movie_id, title, industry, release_year, imdb_rating, studio, and language_id labels provide a solid foundation for comprehensive research.
 This project serves as an efficient and user-friendly means of delving into the dataset, catering to the needs of both novice and advanced SQL users.
 Plus, the repository likely includes a comprehensive README guide to aid in setting up the database, importing the data, and executing queries.![sam](https://github.com/kiransindam/Movie-Review-Analysis-Using-SQL-FOR-PRACTICES/assets/101730779/16b09db3-92e6-4360-b84f-772503134ffe)
